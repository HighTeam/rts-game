# Early decisions tracker

GitHub issue **#21 — Cross-cutting early decisions** is a **meta epic**, not a milestone task you implement in one PR.

Use it as a **checklist of decisions** that must be locked in before they become expensive to change. Each item is **resolved inside the milestone issue where the work happens**, then checked off on #21.

| Decision | Resolved in | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Fixed-point math (Q16.16) | M0 #2 Core loop | Done — `src/math/fixed.hpp` |
| Sim tick rate (20 Hz) | M0 #2 Core loop | Done — `SIM_TICKS_PER_SECOND` in `src/core/constants.hpp` |
| Data-driven civ JSON | M1 | Pending |
| Disconnect / pause policy | M2 | Pending |
| Host migration policy | M3 | Pending |

Do **not** duplicate implementation work on #21. When a decision lands, update this table (optional), check the box on #21, and reference the PR that introduced it.
